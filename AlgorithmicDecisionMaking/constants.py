The file contains sets of constants that are relevant for the recidivism data that
is used for training and testing our Perceptron algorithm.  This file can be imported
by any module that wants to access these constants.

Enumeration of the index numbers of input features in recividism data files.
Each constant refers to the index number for a particular input feature in the data. 
The constants below are grouped by input feature type (i.e., set of binary features
that provide a "one hot" encoding of the underlying value of the feature).
